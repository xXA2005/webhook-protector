# ab5 webhook protector

simply add your webhook in the `.env` file and run it then run `server.py` to start the server on your host (you can use https://repl.it/ and https://uptimerobot.com/ to keep it running) then you can send request to the host url like in `test.py` and it will only accept post and not delete so if they found it it will stay safe
